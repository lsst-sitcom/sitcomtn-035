   The on sky pointing accuracy of the Auxiliary Telescope (AuxTel) is checked in this tech note. The world coordinate system (WCS) solution of the AuxTel images provides a pointing within 0.25 arcesc of the telescope. In this manner, we compare the WCS sky positing with the one reported on the boresight. We derived angular offset of these sky coordinates for images from Feb 2020 up to Mar 2022. And we report an overall pointing accuracy of 57 arcesec. Since the pointing model was edited monthly during most of this time period the pointing offset also changes significantly monthly. In the note you can find the pointing angular offset timeline and distribution, the elevation and azimuth offsets as a function of the elevation and a correlation plot with environmental conditions.
